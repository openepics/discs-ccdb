                Introduction

                Central Configuration Database System (CCDB) is a software tool that assists in managing the configuration of a particle accelerator facility.                    
                It stores physical and logical information about the accelerator and its component systems:
                devices, device types, device properties, relationships among devices, data on installation, alignment, and signals.
                This includes information about magnets, RFQs, RF cavities, diagnostic devices, 
                solenoids, power supplies, valves, pumps etc. It contains device 
                attributes, design parameters, schematics, mechanical layouts and detail 
                drawings, electrical schedules, EM model information, building information, utility 
                installation, geographical location etc. It includes devices from both accelerator 
                and experimental systems. It is part of <h:outputLink value="#{msgs.discs}" target="_blank">DISCS</h:outputLink>.                   
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of the CCDB configuration data are the verification results that equipment is 
                suitable for operation: Readiness Checklists.  Readiness Checklists are used by Device
                Owners and Area Managers to collect input from Subject Matter Experts (SME), and to 
                decide and document device and slot readiness for installation, integrated testing, and/or beam.

                Readiness Checklists
            </h2>
            <p>               
                CCDB Implementation Plan [1], the verbatim source of this section,  
                describes Readiness Checklists in all their gory.
                Readiness Checklists provide a top-down review with Subject Matter Experts (SME) 
                to verify that a device, slot, or subsystem is ready for use, and to ensure that
                higher-level performance and safety requirements that are not specifically part of 
                the configuration attributes will be met.
            </p>
            <p>
                Readiness Checklists can be associated with devices (a physical item that gets installed), 
                slots (the space where a device gets installed; in this context a slot checklist is for the 
                installed device including its interfaces), or groups of slots (a collection of slots with their installed devices, defined by the Area Manager).
                It should be noted that some devices may contain other devices, in an assembly.  
            </p>
            <p>
                One example is cryomodules: the cryomodule itself is a device, and gets installed into a cryomodule slot.  
                Within that physical space is also where the superconducting cavities will reside.  
                Due to the nature of the configuration data that will get collected in the CCDB, both the cavity devices 
                and cryomodule device will have entries in the database, since some important information is associated 
                with the particular cavity, and other information is pertinent to the entire cryomodule assembly.  
                Assemblies in the CCDB relate the parent-child hierarchies so that when a cryomodule device gets installed, 
                the cavity devices that are within it automatically fill the appropriate cavity slots.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Assemblies are not not the same as Groups: assemblies store the physical relationship of devices within a 
                larger device, so those internal devices can move with the larger device and fill appropriate slots when 
                the larger device gets installed; groups are arbitrary collections of slots defined by a user, so those 
                grouped slots can be collectively reviewed with a checklist.  A Group might include a cryomodule slot, 
                the cavity slots, and the adjacent warm beamline slots; or, the Area Manager may choose to group the 
                cryomodule slot with the power supply and RF amplifier rack slots that power power it (and leave out 
                the individual cavity slots).  In this way, groups do not have a predefined physical relationship; they 
                simply provide a method for organizing an Area Manager’s slots and assigning a single checklist to that 
                collection of slots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Area Managers own Slot and Group Readiness Checklists and their supporting data; Device Owners own 
                Device Readiness Checklists and their supporting data.
                Readiness Checklists will contain a status for each of several categories, defined in section 3.2.   
                Sample values are shown in Figure 1 for three Readiness Checklists, displayed in a table format.
                Readiness Checklists may be associated with devices, slots, or groups, at the Area Manager’s discretion 
                and with proper concurrence described in section 4.  The planned checklists at the time of this document’s writing are listed in section 3.4.
            </p>
            <p>
                Checklists for devices—typically critical and complex beamline devices such as cryomodules or 
                magnet assemblies—are primarily to assess the devices’ suitability for installation or as a spare.  
                Area Managers are encouraged to request Readiness Checklists from Device Owners for chosen devices as necessary 
                criteria for that device’s installation or replacement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Checklists for slots and groups are to verify that the devices installed in their slots, and their 
                interfaces to the larger subsystem, are ready for operation.  Checklists for slots and groups are typically a 
                verification that the critical and complex beamline devices are now properly installed and configured for use.
