        The term device is used in various contexts and may have different aspects based on the context. 
                In general, we use it to mean a physical equipment (engineering perspective).
                A device can be independently installed and de-installed as a single unit. 
                It must be measured, tested, tracked, and serialized. 
                It is generally the final product from an engineering group. 
                If there is a one-to-one correspondence between an element and a device, the term device 
                may also be used to mean an element (beam-physics perspective). 
                A device may be composed of other devices. 
                For example, a cryomodule has several cavities and solenoids. 
                This composition is mostly relevant from engineering and operations perspectives, 
                and may not have any significance from beam-physics or controls perspectives.
