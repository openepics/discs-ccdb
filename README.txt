The Central Configuration System (CCDB) is a tool to manage the configuration of an accelerator facility.

More specifically, the CCDB manages the information of thousands of (physical and logical) devices
such as magnets, cavities, BPMs, cameras, PLCs, IOCs, racks, crates, etc…, by defining
their properties, and relationships among the devices.

This information is then consumed both by end-users and other applications 
(e.g. Cable Database, IOC Factory, Csentry) to enable them to successfully perform their domain
specific businesses.
